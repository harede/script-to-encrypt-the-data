# script-to-encrypt-the-data

This script will encrypt the data heavily with combination of two tools openssl and gpg with simmetric keys with 128 bit key.
128-bit encryption is a data/file encryption technique that uses a 128-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data or files.
It is one of the most secure encryption methods used in most modern encryption algorithms and technologies. 
128-bit encryption is considered to be logically unbreakable.

In script enc_tool.sh find this variable "complx" and put there any combination your custom letters, numbers, even not readable letters.
This will be used in combination with password you provide on command line for encryption.
This variable will be added to you password provided on cli to make it very complex.
The combination will be used with some change will be used to encrypt the data with both utilities openssl and gpg.

Encryption is making files very securely encrypted and virtually not breakable.
